# Data explanation

Every given dataset only contains one machine with the *same* `machine_id`. There is no need to match data from different machines.

## recipe_data

The file recipe_data.csv contains three columns: `machine_identifier`, `timestamp`, `recipe`.
`machine_identifier` has string values which don't change, `timestamp` defines the creation
time of a new `recipe` and this column contains the specific product names of a new recipe.

## oee_data

The file oee_data.csv contains three columns: `machine_identifier`, `timestamp`, `expected_cycles_per_minute`, `actual_cycles_per_minute`.
This file contains partial performance metrics of our packaging machines based on target and actual values.
(target: `expected_cycles_per_minute`, actual: `actual_cycles_per_minute`).
`machine_identifier` has string values which don't change, for each datapoint there is a `timestamp`, due to the eventdriven nature of the target and actual values. Each row of `expected_cycles_per_minute` and `actual_cycles_per_minute` has to contain at least one value which isn't null. Both values reflect the performance metric of our machine, the performance is measured on a minutely basis and can be described as follows: 10 cycles/minute = 6 seconds per cycle. The `actual_cycles_per_minute` describe the measured performance for this machine at the given moment over the last minute. The value of `expected_cycles_per_minute` can be adjusted by our customers at any given time. Depending on its value, the machine either throttles or tries to reach the configured performance.

## package_data

The file oee_data.csv contains three columns: `machine_identifier`, `timestamp`, `good_packs`, `reject_packs`.
This file contains the other part of the machine performance metrics - produced packs. These can be divided into
good and reject packs. One machine cycle creates 24 packages, which can be arbitrarily distributed into good and reject.
Each value of the columns `good_packs` and `reject_packs` has an associated `timestamp` which describes the time at what
the machine finished the corresponding cycle. Each row in this dataset is equivalent to one machine cycle.

## error_messages

The files error_messages_accumulated/timeline.csv contain error reasons of our machine and contain the following columns:
    `machine_identifier`, `timestamp`, `accumulated_dead_time`, `identifier`, `station`, `station_instance`, `subsystem_instance`, `code`
Each row in the error_messages_accumulated file has an associated `timestamp` that describes the interval of one hour. `accumulated_dead_time` is the duration of the corresponding error `identifier` in seconds for the matching timestamp.
The column `identifier` is a unique error id of the machine and is equivalent to one error reason. The `identifier` contains combined information of all following columns. The columns `station` and `station_instance` are connected, `station`
describes the station on the machine and `station_instance` describes the occurrence of that station. If `station_instance` = 0
then this station has an occurrence of 1 and if `station_instance` = 1 there are two same stations on this machine.
`subsystem_instance` describes a component on this station and `code` references to a error id on the station with its
subsystem.

The error_messages_timeline file is almost identical and contains the following columns:
    `machine_identifier`, `start_ts`, `end_ts`, `duration_in_s`, `identifier`, `station`, `station_instance`, `subsystem_instance`, `code`
There is one difference, as there are no accumulated values, but the single events of error messages of the machine as a timeline.
Meaning that, `start_ts`, `end_ts` and `duration_ts` describe exactly what they are. The start, end and duration of the corresponding
error.
